# ReinforcementLearning

Business objective is to help company improve their business operation. Client would like to retain good drivers and attract new drivers. In order to achieve the critical business driver, the analytic goal is to help cab drivers maximize profit which will in turn meet the business objective. With maximised profit, the drivers will be incentivised to perform for the company.

However, there are problems facing the cab drivers as listed below:
•	Due to recent electricity price hikes, the cab driver’s profit is nearly flat despite gradual increase in the revenues. 
•	Drivers do not have the capability to choose the best job to pick up that will maximise their profit.
•	There may be healthy numbers of ride requests throughout the day, but different ride poses different challenges such as longer distance or going to remote area.

Using sound Reinforcement Learning (RL) based system will be able to resolve the business problem. The task here is to train a neural network (NN) model, also known as Deep Q-learning (DQN). Using DQN, we would be able to set up an environment similar to the case problem and find a solution. The underlying model for DQN is using Markov Decision Process(MDP) which will seek long term goal of maximizing the profit.

For more details, a PDF overview report is made available.
